## Developer notes
- Spent time: around 3 hours.
- Please note, `thedogapi` not always returns data such as Origin or Description.
- Please note, `Gotham` font is licensed and I used a different Google Font that on first sight looks similar. 
- I haven't implemented any test cases and I wasn't doing any additional optimisation - e.g. for mobile or tablet devices. 
- Project has the best style compability with Chrome.
- In real-life project, the `app.component.ts` will likely not contain direct html, but it would be split into other subcomponents. E.g. often there's some login or other more prioritised/higher hierarchy UI/components that are in `app.component.ts` or `home.component.ts`.
- Additionally different global style can also be better structured in real-life project, using e.g. variables for colors or for font sizing.
